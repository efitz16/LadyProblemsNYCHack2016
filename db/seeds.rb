# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# user = User.create(username: , email: , password: , city: , state: , insurance_company: , policy_name: , bio: , medical_professional: , race: , birthday: )

# user = User.create(username: "User1", email: "user1@me.com", password: "Password1", city: , state: , insurance_company: , policy_name: , bio: , medical_professional: , race: , birthday: )
